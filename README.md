HomeKitBridge
=============
HomeKit Bridge is a project that allows app developers test their HomeKit app with real hardware using Mac as a relay to communicate with accessory that doesn't support HomeKit protocol.

This project uses Apple's private framework "HAPAccessoryKit" which comes with Xcode 6. (It also serve as backbone of HomeKit Simulator)
